**9 Essential Skills to master**
#ai/datascience/machinelearning
(Machine Learning Involves creating Models that Learn from data to make Decisions or Predictions)
1. Focus on Mastering Python first.(1 months)
> Some other may be R,C++,Java for performance Reasons.

2. Version Control System(git)(1 weeks)
> For collaborating and tracking Changes in code.

3. Understand Data Structures and algorithms(1 week)
> Boosts your Problems solving skills, enables you in tackling complex challenges.
> Using right data structures helps you manage large datasets efficiently.

4. Learn SQL(1 week)
> Language for working with Databases.
> Learn SQL for data access and organization needed by the modal

5. Mathematics and Statistics(1 day)
> Machine Learning Modals are built on principles of Linear Algebra,Probability,Statistics,Calculus.

6. Data Handling(2months and needs solid python and SQL)
> Preparing and cleaning the data for your Model.
> Cleaning up data and Organizing it that makes it easy for the model to understand.
> Learn to use tools like PANDAS and NUMPY to Organize and clean the data.
> Lean to visualize data to recognize patterns and Communicate Results. Use python Libraries eg: Matploit Lib,Seabon

7. Learn Machine Learning Fundamentals(1 Month)
> Machine Learning algorithms fall into two categories(Supervised and Unsupervised Learning)
> i. Supervised Learning
>     The machine Learns from labelled data: Each input comes with the known Output
>  ii. Unsupervised Learning
>     The modal works with unlabeled data and tries to figure out patterns and relationships on its own.
>  Learn Tools used to build and Train machine Learning Modals
>       a. Tensor Flow
>       b. PyTorch
>       c. Scikit Learn

8. Dive into Advanced Machine Learning Topics(2 months)
> These topis start making you a Pro
>    i. Ensemble Learning: Combines Multiple Models to improve Performance.
>    ii. Deep Learning: Involves Neural Networks with may Layers.
>         a. Learn Natural Language Processing(NLP): For working with text data.
>         b. Learn Computer Vision: For Working with Images.

9. Model Deployment(1 month)
> Learn how to Put the models you built into Action.
> Build simple web services that lets other applications use your Models.
> Use python frameworks like(python or django)
> Learn Docker: A tool that enables you to package your Modal with all its dependencies.
